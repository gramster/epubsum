epubsum - An EPUB book file summarizer.

This is based on https://github.com/pszemraj/textsum, which handles
plan text and PDF files.

The intent is not to generate good summaries - the model sometimes does
an okay job at that but the output is generally pretty clunky. I wrote
this primarily to generate summaries I could use for faster search.
That said, if you're willing to put up with the clunky writing and
occasional inaccuracies and nonsense, the content is generally pretty 
good for getting an overview of a book.

Run `epubsum --help` for help.
