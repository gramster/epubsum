epubsum - An EPUB book file summarizer.

This is based on https://github.com/pszemraj/textsum, which handles
plan text and PDF files.

The intent is not to generate good summaries - the model sometimes does
an okay job at that but the output is generally pretty unwieldy. I wrote
this primarily to generate summaries I could use for faster search.

Run `epubsum --help` for help.
